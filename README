NAME
    Tcl::pTk - Interface to Tcl/Tk with Perl/Tk compatible syntax

DESCRIPTION
    
    The Tcl::pTk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
    Perl/Tk extension) provides a complete interface to the whole
    of Tk via the Tcl extension. It has full perl/tk compatible syntax for 
    running existing perl/tk scripts, as well as direct-tcl syntax for using any other Tcl/Tk features.
            
    See the POD documentation for more details.
    
Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary only if your Tcl or Tk include files could
not be found automatically by Makefile.PL script. Normally you just make
sure you have right tcl/tk in your path at a moment of running Makefile.PL
script.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Note on Crashing Linux Platforms due to the Tcl package

You may get Core Dumps when trying to run on Linux. This is often due to a problem with the
base Tcl perl package that Tcl::pTk dependes on. This Tcl package can build fine and pass tests,
but when run outside of the build/test environment, it crashes. You can test this by doing
a 'perl -MTcl' on the command line. If this simple script causes a core dump, then you need
to go back and install the Tcl perl package with the --nousestubs option. For example:

  perl Makefile.PL --nousestubs --library=-ltcl8.6 --include=-Itcl-core/include
  make test
  make install
