NAME
    Tcl::Tk extension module for Perl5

DESCRIPTION
    
    The Tcl::Tk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
    Perl/Tk extension) provides a raw but complete interface to the whole
    of Tk via the Tcl extension.

    Have incomplete but quite much support for perlTk syntax (i.e. you can use
    perlTk syntax to use create Tcl/Tk GUI from perl), and existing Tcl/Tk GUI
    could be embedded to Perl without extra coding, including pure-Tcl widgets
    and any widgets that exist in you current Tcl/Tk.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary only if your Tcl or Tk include files could
not be found automatically by Makefile.PL script. Normally you just make
sure you have right tcl/tk in your path at a moment of running Makefile.PL
script.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

In rare case when you do cross-compiling for WinCE, you need to edit
Makefile.PL to reflect your paths, and then invoke as
  perl -MCross=[your-cross-name] Makefile.PL
Please see into Makefile.PL for more details on that.
