NAME
    Tcl::pTk - Interface to Tcl/Tk with Perl/Tk compatible sytax

DESCRIPTION
    
    The Tcl::pTk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
    Perl/Tk extension) provides a complete interface to the whole
    of Tk via the Tcl extension. It has full perl/tk compatible syntax for 
    running existing perl/tk scripts, as well as direct-tcl syntax for using any other Tcl/Tk features.
            
    See the POD documentation for more details.
    
Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary only if your Tcl or Tk include files could
not be found automatically by Makefile.PL script. Normally you just make
sure you have right tcl/tk in your path at a moment of running Makefile.PL
script.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

In rare case when you do cross-compiling for WinCE, you need to edit
Makefile.PL to reflect your paths, and then invoke as
  perl -MCross=[your-cross-name] Makefile.PL
Please see into Makefile.PL for more details on that.
