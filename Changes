Summary of Changes to Tcl::pTk

Release 0.92:  8/21/16

 * Updated to work with Tcl.pm versions > 1.02. Tcl.pm versions > 1.02 broke compatibility
     with Tcl::pTk, so the Tcl 1.02 interface was moved to Tcl/pTk.pm 
 * Added new ttkTixNotebook widget, which emulates the interface of the Tk Notebook widget.
   Updated Facelift.pm to use this new widget, instead of the old tix NoteBook widget.
 * Fix to Wm.pm to handle an rare condition where if Busy is called when a canvas is opened
   in another window, the new window will popup under the existing window, not on top as expected.
 * Fix for a problem with the dialog box widget that would pop up off the screen if running from
   two displays. Added a test case for this condition.
           
Release 0.90:  7/4/15

 * Updates to work with Tcl/Tk 8.6.
 * Added background error handling (including a ErrorDialog.pm file like perl/tk) that is
   more compatible with the way perl/tk does it.
 * Fixed bug where a repeat call would create a TCL-command in TCL-land for each repeated event. 
   Changed to reuse the Tcl-command. Added test case (repeatSubReuse.t)
