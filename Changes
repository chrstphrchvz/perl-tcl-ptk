Summary of Changes to Tcl::pTk

Release 0.90:  7/4/15

 * Updates to work with Tcl/Tk 8.6.
 * Added background error handling (including a ErrorDialog.pm file like perl/tk) that is
   more compatible with the way perl/tk does it.
 * Fixed bug where a repeat call would create a TCL-command in TCL-land for each repeated event. 
   Changed to reuse the Tcl-command. Added test case (repeatSubReuse.t)
